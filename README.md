# Book Search

## Description 

This Book Search Application allows users to create an account, search for books using Google's Book API, and manage their collection of saved books. The motivation behind this project was to create a seamless and intuitive platform for book enthusiasts to explore, save, and manage their favorite books. The application addresses the problem of organizing and maintaining a personal book collection by leveraging a powerful API and providing user-friendly features. Through this project, I learned about integrating third-party APIs, managing user authentication, and implementing CRUD operations within a full-stack application.
